# 🤖 AI Agent with Gemini AI using n8n

This project demonstrates how to build a basic **AI Agent** in **n8n** using **Google Gemini AI**, with memory and calculation capabilities. It automates the process of receiving a user query, processing it using an LLM, maintaining context, and responding with accurate results — including calculations like squaring numbers.

## 🛠️ Features

✅ Integrates **Google Gemini AI** for natural language understanding  
✅ Maintains context using **Simple Memory**  
✅ Performs calculations via **Calculator tool**  
✅ Fully visual, **no-code workflow** in **n8n**  
✅ Handles **real-time user input** and returns intelligent responses
